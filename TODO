Just create the mysql database and set the config file on src/server/config.js

npm install


npm run dev



it automatically create tables on database

it runs the api(back) and the client(front)

the url for submitting invoices using POST and HTTP JSON: http://localhost:3000/api/invoice
{
  "invoice_number": "12345",
  "total": "199.99",
  "currency": "USD",
  "invoice_date": "2019-08-17",
  "due_date": "2019-09-17",
  "vendor_name": "Acme Cleaners Inc.",
  "remittance_address": "123 ABC St. Charlotte, NC 28209"
}



and it runs the client too, only reading pending status, it use an interval of 3 seconds on src/client/components/App.js;
